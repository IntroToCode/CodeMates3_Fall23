## Time to prepare:

## Ingredients: 
Ground Beef – We use 1.5 lbs of 80/20 beef to make 4 double-patty burgers, but you can easily scale the recipe up to feed a crowd (use 3 lbs for 8 double-patty burgers).
Sauce – A simple combination of mayo and yellow mustard is what we use to grill and assemble the burgers.
Cheese – we love thick-sliced medium cheddar cheese for burgers, but you can use American-style cheese or your favorite sliced cheese.
Buns – brioche buns taste great and have that steakhouse burger look, but any burger bun will work
Lettuce – thinly slice your iceberg lettuce for a restaurant-style smash burger
Pickles – sliced dill pickle chips are the best
Tomatoes – Select meaty and large-sized tomatoes for burgers and cut them into rings
Red onion – thinly sliced into rings


## Equipment needed: 
Pan, knife

## Steps for preparation: 
1) pan heat the beef 2) put the beef and other ingredients on buns 3)  Put it in the oven

### Notes: 
Need to have nice beef
